/*
The `console` object is a built-in object in JavaScript that provides
access to various methods for interacting with the console, typically
used for debugging and logging.

The `log` method of the `console` object is used to
output messages to the console.

Inside the parentheses, the string "Hello" represents the message that
we want to output to the console.

When this code is executed, the following steps occur:
1. The JavaScript engine encounters the `console.log` statement.
2. It looks up the `console` object.
3. Then, it calls the `log` method of the `console` object.
4. The string "Hello" is passed as an argument.

The "log" method takes the argument, the "Hello" string, and
displays it in the console of the environment where the
JavaScript code is running.

When the code is executed, it will print "Hello" to the console.

console.log("Hello");
